In order for this application to work, you need to either disable Hibernate features (Database config and Dao classes)
or set up your MySQL database URL and credentials in application.properties.

You may start the application running the main method of the Application class or ApplicationSqlStoreUserAccount class.
You may explore different security environments by uncommenting the @EnableWebSecurity annotation on either
SecurityConfigInMemoryStore or SecurityConfigSqlStore
